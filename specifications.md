Data Model Rationale
Separation of Concerns
Media Entities (Movie, TVShow, Season, Episode):

Represent the conceptual media item 
Independent of physical files 
Can have metadata from Plex/TMDB 
Tracks overall status/notes at media level 
File Entities (MovieFile, EpisodeFile):

Represent actual files on disk 
Multiple files can exist for same media (different qualities, editions) 
Tracks file-specific quality, compatibility, and actions 
Each file independently tracked and managed 
Benefits of This Structure

Multiple Files Per Media: You can have multiple versions of same movie (4K, 1080p, HDR, etc.) and track each separately  
Hierarchy Navigation: View all movies → drill into specific movie → see all file versions 
View all shows → drill into show → view seasons → view episodes → see file(s) 
Flexible Status Tracking: Movie-level: "This movie overall is bad" 
File-level: "The 1080p version is bad, but 4K version is good" 
Clean Deletions: When file is deleted from disk, mark fileExists = false but keep the media entity  
Future-proof: Easy to add features like: Linking to external IDs (TMDB, IMDB, TVDB) 
Multiple editions of same movie 
Special episodes or bonus content 
User Workflows
Initial Library Population
Scanner Process:

Scan filesystem recursively 
Parse filename to extract: Movie: title, year 
TV: series name, season, episode numbers 
Check if Movie/TVShow entity exists (by title matching or Plex ID) If not, create Movie/TVShow → Season → Episode hierarchy 
Create MovieFile or EpisodeFile record 
Run ffprobe to extract quality metadata 
Optionally sync with Plex DB to enrich metadata 
Working Through Files
User opens app and wants to check a specific movie:

Navigate to Movies list 
Search/filter for movie title 
Click movie → see detail view 
View shows all file versions for this movie 
Click specific file → edit quality status, add compatibility tests, notes 
User wants to work through all bad files:

Navigate to Files view (or Movies view) 
Filter by Status = "Bad" 
Bulk select files 
Change Action to "Redownload" 
Optionally unmonitor in Arr apps 
User wants to review a TV show season:

Navigate to TV Shows 
Find show, expand seasons 
Click season → see all episodes 
For each episode, see file status at a glance 
Bulk mark entire season as "Good" if all files check out

File Scanner Service
Inputs:

Media directories to scan (configured in env) 
Scan type: "filesystem", "plex_db", "full" 
Filesystem Scan Process:

Discovery Phase: Recursively walk configured media directories 
Identify video files by extension (mkv, mp4, avi, m4v, etc.) 
Parse directory structure to determine type: /Movies/Movie Name (Year)/ → Movie 
/TV Shows/Show Name/Season XX/ → TV Episode     
Filename Parsing: Movies: Extract title and year from folder/filename 
TV: Extract series name, season number, episode number 
Handle common naming patterns (Plex-style, scene releases) 
Entity Creation/Matching: Check if Movie/TVShow entity exists (by title matching) 
If not: Create Movie or TVShow → Season → Episode hierarchy 
Create or update MovieFile/EpisodeFile record 
Metadata Extraction (ffprobe): Run ffprobe on file 
Extract: Video stream: codec, resolution, bitrate, HDR metadata 
Audio streams: codec, channels, language 
Subtitle tracks: language 
Container format 
Duration 
Store as JSON, parse into database fields 
Deletion Detection: Compare database records with filesystem 
Files in DB but not on disk: mark fileExists = false, update status to DELETED   
Scan History: Create ScanHistory record 
Update counts (added/updated/deleted) 
Log any errors encountered 
Plex Database Sync Process:

Connect to Plex DB: Read-only connection to Plex SQLite database 
Query media_parts for all movie/episode file paths   
Match Files: For each Plex file path, find matching MovieFile/EpisodeFile by filepath 
If match found: Query media_items for quality metadata 
Query metadata_items for title, year, TMDB/IMDB IDs 
Update file record with Plex data 
Mark plexMatched = true 
Set metadataSource = "plex" for fields from Plex     
Entity Enrichment: Update Movie/TVShow entities with Plex metadata (titles, IDs) 
Create hierarchy if missing (some files might be in Plex but not found in filesystem scan) 
Error Handling:

File permission errors → log and continue 
ffprobe failures → log, mark metadata as incomplete 
Plex DB locked → retry or skip, warn user 
Corrupted files → log and mark for review 
Performance Considerations:

Process files in batches (100-500 at a time) 
Parallel ffprobe execution (max 4-8 concurrent) 
Progress reporting via WebSocket or polling endpoint 
Ability to cancel in-progress scan
